MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications.

MCP provides a standardized way to connect to AI models to different data sources and tools.  

Open standard by Anthropic.  

Why MCP ? : 
 - A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into 
 - The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors
 - Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure

What is a Model ?   

A model in AI is like a smart brain trained to do a specific task, such as understanding text, recognizing images or making decisions. 

It learns patterns from lots of data and then uses that knowledge to answer questions or solve problems.
