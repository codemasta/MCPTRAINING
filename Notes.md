## MCP INTRODUCTION

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications.

MCP provides a standardized way to connect to AI models to different data sources and tools.  

Open standard by Anthropic.  

Why MCP ? : 
 - A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into 
 - The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors
 - Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure

What is a Model ?   

A model in AI is like a smart brain trained to do a specific task, such as understanding text, recognizing images or making decisions. 

It learns patterns from lots of data and then uses that knowledge to answer questions or solve problems.

LLL = a specific kind of model for understanding/generating language.


What is a Context ?    

Context means the situation, background or surrounding information that helps you understand the meaning of something. 

Contet forms part of the prompt sent to the AI model. It provides essential background information. 

MCP standardize how AI models interact with external tools and data sources by defining specific components.  

The components are : 
- Tools
- Resources 
- Prompts

What is a Protocol ?   

A protocol is a set of rules or instructions that tells different systems how to talk to each other or work together.

Open Specification 
  - Publicly Accessible, Vendor Neutral. 

Client-Server Architecture 
  - Ensures consistent implementation. 

Reduced Duplication
  - Eliminates redundant integration efforts.  

Ecosystem Development
  - Enables growth around a common standard.
